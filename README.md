Ripen
============

Ripen is a bash script that helps you go from essentially nothing on an Ubuntu
server to a working development or production environment, per your settings.

Requirements & Assumptions
------------

I assume the following in getting this script to work properly:

* You are running Ubuntu 14.04.
* You have installed `openssh-server` and are able to login to your server via
  SSH.
* You login to your server and run this command as the `root` user. In other
  words, you have administrative rights over the server and are running as a
  user which those rights.

While it is possible the script will still work if you stray from these
assumptions, your mileage may vary.

> Note: If you've had success or failures on other operating systems, please
> let me know. It may be easy to tweak for expanded support.

We're not doing much heavy lifting here. A machine with 2GB of RAM should be
more than enough to get up and running. Plus, one option is to add a swapfile
to your system.
