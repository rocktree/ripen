# 
# Ripen Configuration
# ====================
# 
# Use this file to set your configuration before you run the
# ripen command. Then Ripen knows what to do and what to
# ignore.
# 
# -------------------------------------- User Account
# 
# We assume you have no user and add one here. You can
# change the default behavior and the user's attributes.
# 
add_user=true
user=(
  ['username']='burtmacklin'
  ['password']='password'                     # plain text password (will be encrypted)
  ['options']='--create-home --user-group'    # `useradd` command line options
  ['sudo']=true                               # grant all sudo privileges?
)
# 
# We assume you are running this script as "root" but that
# you wouldn't typically login as root. Let's set the user
# you would typically login as.
# 
# NOTE: IF YOU'VE CREATED A NEW USER, THIS SHOULD MATCH THE
# USERNAME YOU CREATED.
# 
username='burtmacklin'
# 
# -------------------------------------- Git
# 
# Git is version control for your code repositories. It is
# widely used by developers in the open source community.
# 
install_git=true
git=(
  ['name']='My Server'                # full name of git user
  ['email']='myserver@example.com'    # email of git user
  ['colors']=true                     # enable coloring in output
)
# 
# -------------------------------------- Nginx
# 
# Nginx is an awesome web server. We don't need to mess with
# it out of the gate. Just choose whether or not to install
# it.
# 
install_nginx=true
# 
# -------------------------------------- Colors
# 
# Ripen uses these colors for output to the console. Feel
# free to change the values if you'd like.
# 
colors=(
  ["black"]="\033[33;30m"
  ["red"]="\033[33;31m"
  ["green"]="\033[33;32m"
  ["yellow"]="\033[33;33m"
